## About

skinmesh is a simple React component that uses the facemesh model from [Tensorflowjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js). The goal is to capture the facial landmarks for analyzing the facial symmetry for cosmetic treatments such as botulinum toxin injections and dermal fillers. Checkout [skinhelpdesk.com](https://skinhelpdesk.com) for backend analysis APIs.

## Use
* Checkout this repo
* npm install && npm build in the parent directory
* npm install && npm start in the example directory
* See console for the output
* The model may take some time to load. The output for any images captured during this period will be null.
* I will add more customizations if there is interest.
